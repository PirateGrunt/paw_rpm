Python for Actuaries Workshops

This is a draft repository for a one-day workshop about Python for actuaries. We are targeting the spring 2019 [Ratemaking, Product and Modeling](https://www.casact.org/calendar/index.cfm?fa=eventView&id=1695) seminar.

This repo will be open for the forseeable future, though it may be made private at some later date. While it is open, if you would like to suggest changes, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
