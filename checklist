Below is a list of items that ought to be covered in a one-day introductory workshop. Very random and stream of consciousness, basically a sanity preservation device for myself.

* list comprehension
* flow control, tabs, spaces
* installing new packages (may not be necessary if we're using colab)
* the python-verse (sorry), i.e. bare bones actuarial toolkit
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * matplotlib
  * sci-kit learn
* 

Framework exercises:

* Cat model
* loss reserve

What's the cake?
